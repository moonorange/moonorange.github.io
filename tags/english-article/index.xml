One common pattern is the job queue model, where multiple tasks (jobs) are submitted to a queue and processed asynchronously by worker routines. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to implement a job queue model in Go using goroutines and channels.
Understanding the Job Queue Model At its core, the job queue model consists of two main components:
Job Queue: The job queue is a data structure that holds tasks awaiting execution.</description></item><item><title>Go Concurrency Model</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</guid><description>Intro This article aims to summarize the key concepts and principles of Go&amp;rsquo;s concurrency model that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.

Goroutines A goroutine is a lightweight independently executing function with its own call stack.
While not equivalent to a thread, conceptually, it can be thought of as a very cheap thread.

Merge sort is a stable sort in the most implementations. The most common implementation does not sort in place, meaning it requires extra space.

Most implementations of quick sort are not stable, but sort in place, meaning it does not require extra space.

What is Two-Factor Authentication? Before writing the TOTP generation code, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly review what two-factor authentication is.
There are mainly three types of factors for authentication: knowledge, possession, and biometrics.

SSTables and LSM Trees(P.76) SSTables (Sorted String Tables) are files that contain a set of arbitrary and sorted key-value pairs.
https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/
SSTables and Log-Structured Merge Trees are still used in some database.
As a rule of thumb, LSM Trees are faster for writes but slower for reads than B-Tree indexes.
B-Trees The B-Tree is the most widely used indexing structure.</description></item><item><title>Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/dsa/dijkstra/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/dsa/dijkstra/</guid><description>What is Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm is the algorithm to find the shortest path between any two vertices in a graph.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of References to other nodes that are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph that has N nodes and N-1 edges.
A Binary Tree is one of the most typical tree structures. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.</description></item></channel></rss>
