A graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set of E of edges. G can be defines as follows $$G=\left(V,E\right)$$ ordered pair $$(a, b) \neq \left(b,a\right) \text{where} ,, a \neq b$$ Graph terminology There are two type of graph, the one is directed graph and the other is undirected graph. Directed graphs contain ordered pairs of vertices while undirected</description></item></channel></rss>
