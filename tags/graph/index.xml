Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm will find the shortest path from a given starting vertex to every other vertices in a graph.
Steps Prepare a table to have the shortest distance from a starting vertex and previous vertex.
Initialize two list of visited and unvisited nodes
Let the distance of a start vertex from the start vertex 0.</description></item><item><title>Intro to Graphs</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/dsa/graph/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/dsa/graph/</guid><description>What is a Graph? A graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set of E of edges. G can be defines as follows $$G=\left(V,E\right)$$ ordered pair $$(a, b) \neq \left(b,a\right) \text{where} \ a \neq b$$ Graph terminology There are two type of graph, the one is directed graph and the other is undirected graph. Directed graphs contain ordered pairs of vertices while undirected</description></item></channel></rss>
