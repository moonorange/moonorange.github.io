The root node can be used to traverse every node of the tree. It is called root because the tree originated from root only. If a tree has N nodes(vertices), the number of edges is always one less than the number of nodes (i.e., N-1). If it has more than that, it&amp;rsquo;s called a graph not a tree.</description></item></channel></rss>
