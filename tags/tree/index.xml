The root node can be used to traverse every node of the tree. It is called root because the tree originated from root only. If a tree has N nodes(vertices), the number of edges is always one less than the number of nodes (i.e., N-1). If it has more than that, it&amp;rsquo;s called a graph not a tree.</description></item><item><title>Binary Tree</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/dsa/binary_tree/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/dsa/binary_tree/</guid><description>Overview A tree is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.
Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes that are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph that has N nodes and N-1 edges.
A Binary Tree is one of the most typical tree structures. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.</description></item></channel></rss>
