Here is a list of posts in the series:
Part 1 - gRPC Microservices Part 2 - GraphQL BFF Part 3 - Deploy services by Kubernetes Full code is in here
We have implemented gRPC servers and BFF in parts 1 and 2.
In part 3, we will deploy those services on Minikube using Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Learn gRPC, GraphQL and Kubernetes by building Microservices in Go: Part 2 - GraphQL BFF</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/projects_to_learn/go_microservices/part2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/projects_to_learn/go_microservices/part2/</guid><description>Intro This is the second post in a series about learning gRPC, GraphQL and Kubernetes by building Microservices in Go.

In part 2, we will develop a BFF server that reads from and writes to these gRPC servers and communicates with clients using GraphQL.</description></item><item><title>Learn gRPC, GraphQL and Kubernetes by building Microservices: Part 1 - Building gRPC Microservices</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/projects_to_learn/go_microservices/part1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/projects_to_learn/go_microservices/part1/</guid><description>Intro This is the first post in a series about learning gRPC, GraphQL and Kubernetes by building Microservices in Go.
In this series of posts, we will embark on a journey to implement a Backend For Frontend (BFF) and microservices architecture, leveraging gRPC and GraphQL. Additionally, we&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to deploy these services locally using Kubernetes.
This project serves as an educational endeavor to understand the microservices communication and the benefits of using gRPC, GraphQL, and Kubernetes.</description></item></channel></rss>
