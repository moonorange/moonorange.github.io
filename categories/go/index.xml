This project serves as an educational endeavor to understand the intricacies of microservices communication and the benefits of using gRPC and GraphQL.
Project Structure(Overview) Our project revolves around three essential components:
Backend For Frontend (BFF): This layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the microservices.</description></item><item><title>Implementation of Job Queue model using goroutine and channel</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/job_queues_go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/job_queues_go/</guid><description>Introduction In concurrent programming, managing tasks efficiently is crucial. One common pattern is the job queue model, where multiple tasks (jobs) are submitted to a queue and processed asynchronously by worker routines. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to implement a job queue model in Go using goroutines and channels.
Understanding the Job Queue Model At its core, the job queue model consists of two main components:
Job Queue: The job queue is a data structure that holds tasks awaiting execution.</description></item><item><title>Go Concurrency Model</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</guid><description>Intro This article aims to summarize the key concepts and principles of Go&amp;rsquo;s concurrency model that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
To test your understanding and reinforce your knowledge, a quiz is available at the end of the article.
Goroutines A goroutine is a lightweight independently executing function with its own call stack.
While not equivalent to a thread, conceptually, it can be thought of as a very cheap thread.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how you can use goroutines:</description></item><item><title>Write a Large Amount of Data to CSV File with Go (Golang)</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/golang_goroutines/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/golang_goroutines/</guid><description>Introduction Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to prepare a substantial amount of data for testing your code? If so, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Working with large datasets is a common requirement in software development, and Go provides some powerful tools to help you accomplish this efficiently.
In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my approach to writing a large amount of data into a CSV file using Go, and I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to leverage Goroutines to make the process more efficient and faster.</description></item><item><title>Golang Basic(Golang基礎)</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/golang/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/golang/</guid><description>概要 Golang についての基礎的な情報をまとめる資料である。 Go とは？ Google が開発したプログラミング言語であり、2009 年に最初のバージョンがオープンソース</description></item></channel></rss>
