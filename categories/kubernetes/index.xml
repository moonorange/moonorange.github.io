In this series of posts, we will embark on a journey to implement a Backend For Frontend (BFF) and microservices architecture utilizing gRPC and GraphQL.
This project serves as an educational endeavor to understand the intricacies of microservices communication and the benefits of using gRPC and GraphQL.
