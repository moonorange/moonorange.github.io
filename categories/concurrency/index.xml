One common pattern is the job queue model, where multiple tasks (jobs) are submitted to a queue and processed asynchronously by worker routines. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to implement a job queue model in Go using goroutines and channels.
Understanding the Job Queue Model At its core, the job queue model consists of two main components:
Job Queue: The job queue is a data structure that holds tasks awaiting execution.</description></item><item><title>Go Concurrency Model</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</guid><description>Intro This article aims to summarize the key concepts and principles of Go&amp;rsquo;s concurrency model that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.

Goroutines A goroutine is a lightweight independently executing function with its own call stack.
While not equivalent to a thread, conceptually, it can be thought of as a very cheap thread.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how you can use goroutines:</description></item></channel></rss>
