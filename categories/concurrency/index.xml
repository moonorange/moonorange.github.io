One common pattern is the job queue model, where multiple tasks (jobs) are submitted to a queue and processed asynchronously by worker routines. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to implement a job queue model in Go using goroutines and channels.
Understanding the Job Queue Model At its core, the job queue model consists of two main components:
Job Queue: The job queue is a data structure that holds tasks awaiting execution.</description></item><item><title>Go Concurrency Model</title><link>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moonorange.github.io/posts/programming_language/go_concurrency_model/</guid><description>Intro This article aims to summarize what I have learnt about Go&amp;rsquo;s concurrency model
Goroutines A goroutine is a lightweight independently executing function with its own call stack.
While not equivalent to a thread, conceptually, it can be thought of as a very cheap thread.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how you can use goroutines:
package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; ) func somefunc() { fmt.Println(&amp;#34;called by goroutine&amp;#34;) } func main() { go somefunc() // Wait a while not to exit main goroutine before finishing another goroutine time.</description></item></channel></rss>
