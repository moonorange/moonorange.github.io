# Heap

Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which tree is a complete binary tree.
Heaps are basically are binary trees with more properties and specifications and there are mainly two types of heaps.

Rules

- A heap must be a complete binary tree.
  - All of the levels of the tree must be completely filled except maybe the last one.
  - The last level has all keys as left as possible

## Types of heap

`Min Heap`

In min heap, all elements are smaller than their children. The root node will be the smallest element.

`Max Heap`

In max heap, all elements are bigger than their children. The root node will be the biggest element.
